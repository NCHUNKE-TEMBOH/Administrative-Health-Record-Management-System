Administrative Hospital Management System 
Works more like a record Tracker in a Hospital where the Super Admin is in charge of Managing everthing "we could talk of workflow in this case" 

# what gets mainly used
- We will be following an MVC model and a Microservice Architecture for our sytem Design
- Front end Will make use of HTML, CSS Js and/or Bootstrap
- Backend Developers will be in charge of ensuring Cohesion and Coupling Between Various Parts of the System
- -- There by designing Various Segmets of the application for the microservice architecture to get implemented.
- We would create an open API (Custom API) for this project using Flask

What is Microservice Architecture?
Microservice architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services, each of which implements a specific business functionality. These services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

#Benefits of Using Microservices for a Hospital Management System

Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on it's load. 
For example, the appointment scheduling service can be scaled-up during peak hours without affecting other services.

Flexibility in Technology Stack: Different services can use different technologies best suited for their specific requirements. 
For instance, a service handling real-time patient data can be built with a high-performance, low-latency technology.

Independent Deployment: Services can be updated, deployed, and maintained independently, leading to faster development cycles and reduced downtime.

Resilience and Fault Isolation: If one service fails, it doesnâ€™t necessarily bring down the entire system. This increases the overall reliability and availability of the system.

Ease of Maintenance and Development: Smaller codebases for individual services are easier to manage and understand, making development and maintenance more efficient.

# Example Microservices for a Hospital Management System

- Patient Management Service: Handles patient records, including personal details, medical history, and demographics.
- Appointment Scheduling Service: Manages scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellations of patient appointments.
- Doctor Management Service: Manages doctor profiles, specializations, schedules, and availability.
- Medication Management Service: Manages prescriptions, medication inventory, and dispensing.


Notification Service:Sends notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications for appointments, medication reminders, and alerts.

Authentication and Authorization Service: Manages user authentication, role-based access control, and security.

Report Generation Service: Generates various reports for administrative purposes, medical staff, and patients.

# Implementation Considerations
- API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservice. It can also handle concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and logging.

- Service Discovery: Helps services to find and communicate with each other. Tools like Eureka or Consul can be used for service discovery.

- Load Balancing: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple instances of a service to ensure reliability and performance.

- Data Management: Decide on data management strategies, including databases. Each microservice can have its own database (polyglot persistence) or share a database,
depending on the use case.

Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging to track the health, performance, and issues within each service. 
Inter-Service Communication: Choose between synchronous communication (e.g., REST or gRPC) and
asynchronous communication (e.g., message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka) based on the interaction pattern.

Example of Microservice Interaction
Let's consider an example where a patient books an appointment:

API Gateway receives the request and forwards it to the Appointment Scheduling Service.
Appointment Scheduling Service verifies the patient's details with the Patient Management Service.
the Appointment Scheduling Service checks the doctor's availability using the Doctor Management Service.
Once the appointment is scheduled, a confirmation is sent to the Notification Service, which sends an email/SMS to the patient.
The appointment details are logged for reporting purposes using the Report Generation Service.
Conclusion
Microservice architecture can significantly enhance the functionality, maintainability, and scalability of a hospital management system. 
By breaking down the system into smaller, manageable services, development teams can work more efficiently and effectively, ensuring a robust, high-performing, and user-friendly application.
